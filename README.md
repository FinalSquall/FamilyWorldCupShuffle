FamilyWorldCupShuffle
=====================

Novice Fun Project created for the World Cup some time ago, using it to familiarize myself with Github

Takes a number of players for input, followed by the name of each player. Calculates the most efficient
way to split teams up based on the number of players, shuffles the teams and assigns them to players.

Each users team is output as a text file at directory C://Users/UserName/WorldCupTeams/INPUTNAME.txt
